 Grab Device ECID, ApNonce, BoardConfig and iPhoneID from device and grab signed SHSH via TSSChecker
 
 UPDATE - Now grabs NONC: from recovery mode using irecovery and fixed model names breaking the request (tested with iPad5,3)

 Fixed the boardconfig of the iPhone11,6 being cut off 
 Now grabs ApNonce from Recovery Mode. (ApNone set in NVRAM)
